    Executes the full merging pipeline:

    1. Loads RDF and SHACL graphs from given file paths or RDFLib inputs.
    2. Extracts key elements used in reasoning:
       - target classes (C)
       - focus nodes (P)
       - relevant properties (F)
       - same-as identity tracking (N)
    3. Performs reasoning, inference, and merging on the data graph.
    4. Annotates the resulting graph with owl:sameAs triples for all merged entities.
    5. Returns the final fused graph, same-as dictionary, and the parsed shapes graph.

    Returns:
        - fused_data_graph: Graph after reasoning and merging
        - same_as_dict: Dict[node â†’ set[node]] of merged identities
        - shapes_graph: Original parsed SHACL shapes graph
